# Adaptive Semi-supervised Federated Learning with Selective Knowledge Distillation

This work builds on the work of [FedMD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03581)

### Hypothesis 01 : Introducing poisonous nodes in the federated network can have negative impact on collaborative learning

#### Experiemnt: Introduce varying number of poisoned node in all four environments of FedMD an observe the impact on collaborative learning.

#### Results:
